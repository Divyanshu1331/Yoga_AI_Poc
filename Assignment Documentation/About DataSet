Dataset Overview: 
Since a relevant dataset for personalized wellness insights was not readily available, a custom dataset was created to simulate user data. 
This dataset is designed to capture realistic scenarios for analysis and testing.


Dataset Features (The dataset includes the following columns):
User_ID: A unique identifier for each user.
Pose_Proficiency: A score (0â€“100) representing the user's proficiency in performing various poses.
Session_Duration: The total time (in minutes) the user spends per session.
Engagement_Score: A numerical rating between 1 to 10 telling how good the user is engaged in the activity.
Weight (kg): The user's weight in kilograms, used to calculate personalized metrics like calorie burn.
Calorie_Burn: An estimated number of calories burned during a session, derived using weight and session duration.

Dataset Creation:
The dataset was generated programmatically using Python libraries:
NumPy: Used to create random numerical data simulating pose proficiency scores and session durations.
Pandas: Used for structuring and organizing the data into a tabular format with meaningful columns.
