                                                  PROJECT TITLE:-  Personalized Wellness Insights


INTRODUCTION:-
The Personalized Wellness Insights project aims to provide wellness reports based on user-specific data, including pose proficiency, session duration, and engagement 
score. In today's fast-paced world, personalized feedback is crucial for improving individual fitness and wellness journeys. This project bridges the gap by leveraging 
user data to generate actionable insights, enabling users to monitor their progress and optimize their wellness routines. By analyzing key parameters, this system 
empowers users to set realistic goals, track improvement, and stay motivated throughout their wellness journey.


DATA:-
Dataset Overview: Since a relevant dataset for personalized wellness insights was not readily available, a custom dataset was created to simulate user data. 
This dataset is designed to capture realistic scenarios for analysis and testing.

Dataset Features (The dataset includes the following columns):
User_ID: A unique identifier for each user.
Pose_Proficiency: A score (0â€“100) representing the user's proficiency in performing various poses.
Session_Duration: The total time (in minutes) the user spends per session.
Engagement_Score: A numerical rating between 1 to 10 telling how good the user is engaged in the activity.
Weight (kg): The user's weight in kilograms, used to calculate personalized metrics like calorie burn.
Calorie_Burn: An estimated number of calories burned during a session, derived using weight and session duration.

Dataset Creation:
The dataset was generated programmatically using Python libraries:
NumPy: Used to create random numerical data simulating pose proficiency scores and session durations.
Pandas: Used for structuring and organizing the data into a tabular format with meaningful columns.

Dataset Availability:
The dataset is included in the repository as yoga_dataset.csv. It can be loaded directly for analysis and testing purposes.
