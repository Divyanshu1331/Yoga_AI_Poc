                                                  PROJECT TITLE:-  Personalized Wellness Insights
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTRODUCTION:-

The Personalized Wellness Insights project aims to provide wellness reports based on user-specific data, including pose proficiency, session duration, and 
engagement score. In today's fast-paced world, personalized feedback is crucial for improving individual fitness and wellness journeys. This project bridges the 
gap by leveraging user data to generate actionable insights, enabling users to monitor their progress and optimize their wellness routines. By analyzing key 
parameters, this system empowers users to set realistic goals, track improvement, and stay motivated throughout their wellness journey.

APPROACH:-

Problem Definition: Designed a system to generate personalized wellness reports based on user-specific metrics like pose proficiency, session duration, engagement,
weight, and calorie burn.

Data Creation: Created a synthetic dataset using NumPy and Pandas, structured with key features to simulate real-world user data.

Insights Generation: Extracted trends in pose proficiency and engagement levels over time. Also by using visualization techniques I told how the weight loss, 
and calorie burn are achived. What are underlying phenomenon that are occuring in the dataset which can be useful to get better results.

Visualization and Reporting:
Visualized key findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn including:Line graphs for progress tracking, Bar charts for engagement and calorie burn comparison.
Also at the end Model performance plots are plotted to show how the models are predicting the values.
 
Model Training: Trained the dataset on the following regression models to predict wellness metrics:
Linear Regression
Lasso Regression
Decision Tree

Performance Analysis: Evaluated model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. Also Plotted the pericted values on 
the test samples(feature) against real values.

DATASET:-

Dataset Overview: Since a relevant dataset for personalized wellness insights was not readily available, a custom dataset was created to simulate user data. 
This dataset is designed to capture realistic scenarios for analysis and testing.

Dataset Features (The dataset includes the following columns):
User_ID: A unique identifier for each user.
Pose_Proficiency: A score (0â€“100) representing the user's proficiency in performing various poses.
Session_Duration: The total time (in minutes) the user spends per session.
Engagement_Score: A numerical rating between 1 to 10 telling how good the user is engaged in the activity.
Weight (kg): The user's weight in kilograms, used to calculate personalized metrics like calorie burn.
Calorie_Burn: An estimated number of calories burned during a session, derived using weight and session duration.

Dataset Creation:
The dataset was generated programmatically using Python libraries:
NumPy: Used to create random numerical data simulating pose proficiency scores and session durations.
Pandas: Used for structuring and organizing the data into a tabular format with meaningful columns.

Dataset Availability:
The dataset is included in the repository as yoga_dataset.csv. It can be loaded directly for analysis and testing purposes.

NEXT STEPS:-

Refinement of Models: Explore additional machine learning models, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, to enhance predictions. Fine-tune hyperparameters to 
improve model accuracy further.

Integration of Real-World Data: Replace synthetic data with real-world user data for validation and applicability. Collaborate with fitness professionals to 
collect meaningful datasets.

Feature Expansion: Add more features such as age, gender, fitness goals, and activity type to make insights more personalized.

Deployment: Develop a web-based or mobile application to deliver wellness reports dynamically to users.
